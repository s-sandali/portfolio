    "bio": "I build things. Sometimes they live on screens, sometimes they sneak into the real world. From crafting full-stack apps, to experimenting with IoT and embedded systems, I love turning ideas into stuff that actually works. I also dabble in UI/UX, because things should not only work, they should feel right. And when I’m not tinkering with tech, I’m diving into CIMA, trying to make sense of the numbers behind it all.Basically, I’m a curious mind with messy hair, a love for creating, and a soft spot for turning “what if?” into “heck yes, it works.”",
